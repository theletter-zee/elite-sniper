<h1> 🤔 How does it work? </h1>

When a user sends a message it is stored within Discord's database.
If that user deletes their message, it isn't completely gone until Discord's [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) is reset.

This is where Elite Sniper comes in! Elite Sniper uses Discord's own API to capture that message when it gets deleted and spit it back out when told.



<h1> 🤨 What is the purpose? </h1>

There is a popular demand for snipe bots among users and since snipe bots are nearing their end in terms of
discord's new message content policy, I wanted to make this as ethical as possible and make it for anyone hoping to create their own snipe bot for their server.

<h1> 📜 Terms of Serivce </h1>

<h2> Restrictions </h2>

**Do not use this service to harm others.** The main purpose of this bot is to spit out a silly message someone might've sent. It's similar to when someone makes a typo and they get teased. Getting deleted messages may be fun with friends or people you feel comfortable around but privacy is also important.
<br>
<h2> Termination </h2>

You’re free to opt out of getting your message sniped by another user at any time. You can do this by navigating to `:-settings`. This would also restrict you from sniping messages from other people and will
delete any message that a user has sniped from you.


<h1> ✉️ Privacy </h1>

<h2> What information is used? </h2>


▫️ **Server id** <br>
└ If your server isn't publicly advertised, even if you have 500 members just by sharing the server link, the id is useless on it's own and can't be tracked. However, if your server is advertised publicly, such as on websites, then entering the server id in a search engine would show results sometimes. This ONLY works if you've advertised it publicly. **| What do I use it for? :** (1) It shows me what servers are the most 'reliant' on the bot. It tells me if the servers that use this service are typically big or small. (2) Custom server prefixes tend to be the popular option and currently, I'm testing out individual prefixes. If I end up going with server prefixes then server id's is what i'd have to use. <br>

▫️ **User id** <br>
└ Your user id is public to anyone that comes in contact with you or simply see you on their side menu. To get someone's user id you can enable it in the advanced settings. For developers, it's a great way to manage how you interact with their bot. **What do I use it for? :** I use it for assigning your custom prefix and your chosen language. <br>


▫️ **Channel id & Message id** <br>
└ Similar to your server id and message id, these are both useless on their own. <br>
They are however useful for the bot in order to get rid of your sniped messages if you decide that you no longer want to use the service. Your channel id and message id is stored in that json file so that if you ever want to get rid of those sniped embeds of yours, the bot will read the json and remove all of your sniped messages along with your place in the json file. <br>

The reason why I stress this so much is because I want give users who are in a private server, closure. Knowing that by just having their channel id and message id, isn't enough to create an invite to their server.
Let's say for example we were to click on a message link from a server that we weren't in such as this: <br>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8SRloNw.png" title="Discord links broken down"/> <br>

In the screenshot you can see 1. The server id 2. The channel id 3. The message id (in that order) <br>
Now this is a public server, so if you entered the server id you should get some information if you looked it up. However the same wouldn't apply for a private server. <br>

If you aren't in the server and you click on that link, this message will appear: <br>

**I do not store any of your messages** That would be a clear invasion of privacy, and I would get in trouble.
