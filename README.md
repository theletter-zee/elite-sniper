<h1> 🤔 How does it work? </h1>

When a user sends a message it is stored within Discord's database.
If that user deletes their message, it isn't completely gone until Discord's [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) is reset.

This is where Elite Sniper comes in! Elite Sniper uses Discord's own API to capture that message when it gets deleted and spit it back out when told.



<h1> 🤨 What is the purpose? </h1>

There is a popular demand for snipe bots among users and since snipebots are nearing their end in terms of
discord's new policy, I wanted to make this for anyone hoping to create their own snipebot for their server.


<h1> 📜 Terms of Serivce </h1>

<h2> Restrictions </h2>

**Do not use this service to harm others.** The main purpose of this bot is to spit out a silly message someone might've sent. It's similar to when someone makes a typo and they get teased. Getting deleted messages may be fun with friends or people you feel comfortable around but privacy is also important.

<h2> Termination </h2>
You’re free to opt out of getting your message sniped by another user at any time. You can do this by navigating to `:-settings`. This would also restrict you from sniping messages from other people.


<h1> ✉️ Privacy </h1>

<h2> What information is collected? </h2>


▫️ **Server id** <br>
└ If your server isn't publicly advertised, even if you have 500 members just by sharing the server link, the id is useless on it's own and can't be tracked. However, if your server is advertised publicly, such as on websites, then entering the server id in a search engine would show results sometimes. This ONLY works if you've advertised it publicly. **| What do I use it for? :** (1) It shows me what servers are the most 'reliant' on the bot. It tells me if the servers that use this service are typically big or small. (2) Custom server prefixes tend to be the popular option and currently, I'm testing out individual prefixes. If I end up going with server prefixes then server id's is what i'd have to use. <br>

▫️ **User id** <br>
└ Your user id is public to anyone that comes in contact with you or simply see you on their side menu. To get someone's user id you can enable it in the advanced settings. For developers, it's a great way to manage how you interact with their bot. **What do I use it for? :** I use it for assigning your custom prefix and your chosen language.
