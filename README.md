<h1> 🤔 How does it work? </h1>

When a user sends a message it is stored within Discord's database.
If that user deletes their message, it isn't completely gone until Discord's [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) is reset.

This is where Elite Sniper comes in! Elite Sniper uses Discord's own API to capture that message when it gets deleted and spit it back out when told.



<h1> 🤨 What is the purpose? </h1>

There is a popular demand for snipe bots among users and since snipebots are nearing their end in terms of
discord's new policy, I wanted to make this for anyone hoping to create their own snipebot for their server.
