<h1> ü§î How does it work? </h1>

When a user sends a message it is stored within Discord's database.
If that user deletes their message, it isn't completely gone until Discord's [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) is reset.

This is where Elite Sniper comes in! Elite Sniper uses Discord's own API to capture that message when it gets deleted and spit it back out when told.

To show you a little example of what I mean, take a look at images.
Any user can view a deleted image without the use of a bot by simply
navigating to `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\discord\Cache`

1. Navigated to Cache

Note: This is only an example. The same process cannot be done to view
deleted messages.

<h1> üñ•Ô∏è What Data Is Collected? </h1>

I want to be **100%** transparent here! And make 1 thing clear.
I do NOT store any deleted message or image. I can't even view them. It is completely localized to the server and once Discord's cache resets, it's gone for good.

Getting this bot verified was hard enough as it is, storing your private info is a clear violation of TOS.

With all that being said, the only thing the bot stores is the amount of times a command is used. That's it.


<h1> ü§® Why Create This? </h1>

If you're around the right group of people, this bot is hilarious to have around. I know this because I created it out of inspiration from dank memer's own snipe command, and it was really fun to play with among friends.

I don't know what your use case with this bot is but the intended goal is just for a light laugh when your buddy or someone on your server deletes a silly message. Yours might be for moderation `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`
