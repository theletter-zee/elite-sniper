<h1> 🤔 How does it work? </h1>

When a user sends a message it is stored within Discord's database.
If that user deletes their message, it isn't completely gone until Discord's [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) is reset.

This is where Elite Sniper comes in! Elite Sniper uses Discord's own API to capture that message when it gets deleted and spit it back out when told.
